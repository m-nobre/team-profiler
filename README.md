Laravel Teams Profiler (Change frontend Team denomination)

Just by adding non intrusive routes (which become ineffective upon package removal despite requiring manual removal) this package makes it possible to effectively change the appearance of all team routes into the denomination chose in the team-profiler.php config file which can be published by following instructions below.
The remaining terms spread out in Jetstream views are also and literaly translated into the denomination in the EN locale, for this, lang folder with en.json will be created.
Please remember that despite the apparent stability, this is still in development and should be only used as a starting point for more robust solution
## Installation


>:warning: **New applications only** 
>Team-Profiler should only be installed into new Laravel Jetstream applications 
>Requirements: 
>> EN locale 
>> Creates a Lang/en.json file, does not exist in new applications. 
>> To change denomination from "project" please publish config file. 
>> Once denomination has been changed, lang file needs to be deleted so it's generated using the new denomination. 
>For all the reasons above, Team-Profiler should **only** be installed into **new** Laravel Jetstream applications, attempting to install Team-Profiler into an existing Laravel application may result in unexpected behavior, issues and/or loss of data (namely routes or translations being replaced).
>Routes will be added to routes/web.php and translation file will be added as lang/en.json, make sure to back up these files case theres work you would like to save or ensure it is only installed on a new application.
